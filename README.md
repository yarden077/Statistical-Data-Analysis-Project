# Statistical-Data-Analysis-Project
The data I used is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset

This project is divided into 5 parts, each applying different statistical methods for data analysis:
- **Part 1 - Initial Data Analysis:**
  - Conducted initial exploratory analysis of the dataset.
  - The preliminary descriptive analysis involves examining the distributions of numerical columns, representing categorical variables, and formulating research questions.

- **Part 2 - Statistical Inference: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing:**
  - This part focuses on examining whether alcohol consumption varies between men and women. . The analysis involves checking for outliers, interpreting box plots, and evaluating the influence of explanatory variables on the explained variable using odds ratios and likelihood ratio tests.

- **Part 3 - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:**
  - This section applies linear regression to determine how fried potato consumption, depression, and smoking history influence alcohol consumption. It also uses logistic regression to analyze the impact of weight and height on heart disease and evaluate different models using metrics like AIC. Additionally, it examines associations between variables such as height, weight, smoking history, and the occurrence of heart disease.

- **Part 4 - Bootstrap Method:**
  

- **Part 5 - Bayesian Inference and Missing Data:**
