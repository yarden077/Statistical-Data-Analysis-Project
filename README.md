# Statistical-Data-Analysis-Project
The data I used is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset
This project is divided into 5 parts, each applying different statistical methods for data analysis:

Part 1 - Initial Data Analysis:

Conducted initial exploratory analysis of the dataset.
Part 2 - Statistical Inference: Estimation and Hypothesis Testing:

Analyzed the relationship between depression and BMI among women aged 18-64.
Part 3 - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:

Investigated the impact of depression, fried potato consumption, and BMI on green vegetable consumption.
Explored the effect of diabetes, smoking history, and BMI on heart diseases.
Part 4 - Bootstrap Method:

Applied bootstrap-based methods to revisit questions from Part 3.
Part 5 - Bayesian Inference and Missing Data:

Used Bayesian statistics to revisit questions from Part 2.
Created a new dataset using height, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and weight features.
Addressed missing values in the weight column using non-random methods.
